This Python script is a part of a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project using several packages and tools (including browser automation tool Selenium), and executing tasks on some external data source.

Program starts by importing necessary packages:
- `log_app.log` for logging events
- `helpers` which might include some dataclasses
- `tasks` which is used to define each task that will be executed
- `tasks_methods.methods` where `ScraperMethods`, `ProducerMethods`, and `ExcelOtherMethods` are defined. These must contain the actual code of different tasks.
- `RPA.Browser.Selenium` is an interface to use the Selenium Webdriver for controlling web browsers.

# Template WorkItem
[
  {
      "payload": {
          "phrase_test": "Trump", 
          "section": "Pollitic", 
          "sort_by": 1,
          "results": 15
      }
  }
]

# Instructions for Workitem
- "phrase_test" : content to search
- "section": topics to filter (if exists)
- "sort_by": relevance = 0 , newest = 1, oldest = 2
- "results": how many results have to be collected

# Task `scraper_and_output_file`
The task `scraper_and_output_file` starts execution by calling the `get_work_item()` method from the `ScraperMethods` class.
